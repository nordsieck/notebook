#### Baking

* When baking in a dutch oven, it is important to heat it to oven temp
  before adding dough to it. This drastically cuts down on the amount
  the bread sticks to the sides of the dutch oven. I'd guess that this
  is caused by steam escaping along the sides of the dutch oven -
  preventing the dough from sticking to it.

#### Hearing protection

* Ear plugs are normally rated as an NRR (noise reduction rating) number.
  Noise isolating earbuds and other devices often advertise a number
  without using the term NRR. These numbers are not comperable.
